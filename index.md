<h2>I am Director of Product Infrastructure for <a href="http://www.jacksonriver.com/">Jackson River</a>.</h2>

I manage the infrastructure for [Springboard](https://www.gospringboard.com/), a non-profit fundraising and advocacy platform. I work remotely from Washington, DC.

On any given day, I can be found working on AWS (often with Terraform), writing Chef cookbooks, and developing with PHP, Ruby and Python.

I worked briefly as a Technical Account Manager at [Acquia](https://www.acquia.com/), where I had an opportunity to share my 10+ years of [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) expertise with enterprise clients.

I earned a Master of Science in Information Studies from Florida State University (Tallahassee, Florida, USA).
