## I am a product manager at [Acquia](https://www.acquia.com).

I work on [Acquia Content Hub](https://www.acquia.com/products/acquia-cloud-platform/content-hub), a service that helps syndicate content across [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) sites. I work remotely from Washington, DC.

Prior to joining Acquia, I worked at [Jackson River](https://www.jacksonriver.com), where I was the Director of Product Infrastructure for Springboard, a SaaS platform for non-profit fundraising and advocacy.
